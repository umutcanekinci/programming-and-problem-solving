Suppose that you are given a task of developing some modules(parts) of Remote Education Application(i.e. Sakai) in C++
by your team leader with following requirements:

Your application will consist of six different classes which are
	Instructor
	Student
	Course
	Assignment
	Submission
	Test(class with main method)

No need to explicitly write for all classes below,we are expecting from you to implement all the "necessary" constructors, getter-setter ,
toString and equals methods.


Instructor has the following attributes and methods:
	name
    surname
	academicTitle //String i.e. "Assist.Prof."
	instructorCourses //ArrayList<Course>

	createCourse()
	createAssignment()
	printStudentList()
	printAssignments() //will trigger same method in Course class
	viewSubmissions() //will trigger printSubmission() in Assignment class

	example mail format for Instructor -> name.surname@yasar.edu.tr
	example fullname for Instructor -> Assist.Prof. Dindar Oz

Student has the following attributes and methods:
	id //String i.e. 13070001000
	enrolledCourses //ArrayList<Course>

	enrollCourse()
	submitAssignment()
	printAssignments() //will trigger same method in Course class

Course has the following attributes and methods:
	name //String
	enrolledStudents //ArrayList<Student>
	assignments //ArrayList<Assignment>

	addStudent() //enrollCourse() from Student will trigger this
	addAssignment() //createAssignment() from Instructor will trigger this

	printAssignments() //where the assignments of that Course actually printed

Assignment has the following attributes and methods:
	title //String i.e. "Homework #1"
	instructions //String i.e. "Do this, do that, code this etc."
	submissions //ArrayList<Submission>

	addSubmission()
	printSubmission()

Submission has the following attributes and methods:
	owner //String i.e. "Atabarış Ayaydın" -> fullname
	attachment //String i.e. "week2.c++"
