/**
 * * 5.2. Write a function that takes an integer array and its size as paramaters.
 * *      The function prints the array without using loops
 */
// !your code here

/* [OPTIONAL] Self-Study
 * Write a program that reads three integers from the user (keyboard) namely n, a and b. Your program should print all positive numbers that are smaller than n and the sum of whose positive divisors is between to a and b (included).
 * You should print the numbers in ascending order and print
 * their positive divisors and the sum of their positive divisors on the same line as the numbers.
 * Example:
 * If the user entered n : 5, a : 5 and b : 10 then only 3 and 4 satisfies the condition
 *         and the output should be as follows:
 * 3 1 3 4
 * 4 1 2 4 7
